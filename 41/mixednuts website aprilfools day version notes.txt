#Checklist:
- The 90's is to webdesign what Brutalism is to architecture
-- the later years look has obvious drop shadows and beveled things/images
- Say "Welcome to.." avoid describing what the site is actually about as much as possible
- Site browser title bar text scrolls. http://www.htmlmarquee.com/title.html
- site best viewed in X browser at WxH resolution , also http://www.cutcodedown.com/images/bestViewedHD.png
- Hit counters , preferably skueomorphic like it's from a car odometer or as an LED segement display with big border. http://fakecounter.com/
- built in search bar like from google or lycos
- Mailbox for email contact
- Layout over use of images - Distorted Image aspect ratios. Image to big? just squish it in.
- Excessively long flash based splash/loading intro

Content
- Content should touch the edges, sometimes even going clipping past it
- Frames - especially for navigation
- "broken urls" that are the default system/theme templates, often has reminder text to replace with real content. This default template looks a lot better than the real content
- absolutely not responsive or friendly to mobile
Imagery
- Animated Gifs , american flag ('made in usa' for extra zing) ,  bonus if gifs have obvious white edging or are poorly made cgi.
- "particle effects" things like snowflakes,bubbles,glitter,ash etc moving/falling on the page https://codepen.io/romswellparian/pen/JoXoKo
- Wallpaper backgrounds
--viewport filling background images, very few sections have any child background hiding the main eyesore
-- Tiled images as background
- Clip art like 'champaigne bottle', 'pointing finger', 'mail box', or under construction (http://www.textfiles.com/underconstruction/ http://www.donotenter.com/cool/ucgraphics/) .
-- images of doorways, "trippy" images , images of the earth, preferbly bad cgi&rotating, images of 3D primitives rotating/spinning preferbly multi colored like a rubiks cube with RGB&Y
-- images with seperated color channels. https://cdn2.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/02/EverythingElse-520x320.jpg
- custom mouse cursors , bonus if animated
- Canned drop shadows applied to anything, i.e. image of a drop shadow edited onto another image not a custom drop shadow for that images content.
Typography
- Comic Sans text is the cliche, bad foreground&background contrast for text
- typography has really bad kerning and line-heights
- centered text paragraphs
- Scrolling Marquees -  Text. http://visualidiot.com/articles/css3 , http://wigflip.com/signbot/ 
- Blinking Text
- text overlaying background images, avoiding any type of text flow around objects.
- Heading text highlighted in big blocks
- Blue hyperlinks and if there's one there should be alot of them
- WordArt common themes fire,chrome, glittered,rainbow,balloon.
-- Gradient text in styles like flame,chrome,rainbow
- image based text
